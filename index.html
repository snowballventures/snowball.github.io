            <h2>Our Main Thesis</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; &emsp; Over the last few decades, the number of publicly traded companies in the United States has significantly declined, dropping from over 8,000 in the 1990s to under 6,000 today. This reduction is driven by various factors, including high regulatory burdens, intense competition, and substantial costs associated with going public. Consequently, some of the most innovative and high-growth companies are opting to stay private for longer periods. For instance, iconic companies like Microsoft and Amazon went public in 1986 and 1997, respectively, with initial valuations of $778 million and $300 million. However, in the current landscape, many venture-backed companies remain private despite valuations exceeding $10 billion, and in some cases, even over $100 billion.
            </p>
            <p>       
                &emsp; &emsp; These privately held companies are not just surviving; they are thriving. They boast thousands of employees, dominate their respective industries, exhibit excellent product-market fit, and grow at rates surpassing those of typical public companies. At Snowball Ventures, we specialize in designing investment products that grant investors access to these pre-IPO companies. We believe that the risk associated with investing in these mature, high-growth private companies is substantially lower than traditional venture capital investments. Moreover, their growth trajectories often outpace those of publicly traded firms, offering significant upside potential.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; &emsp; These companies are magnets for top talent, attracting some of the brightest minds in the industry. They are well-capitalized, often cash flow positive, and continue to expand rapidly. By partnering with Snowball Ventures, investors can seize the opportunity to invest in these exceptional companies before they go public. Our products are crafted to help investors participate in the success of these firms, leveraging their established market positions and robust growth prospects to deliver substantial returns. We believe that engaging with us and utilizing our investment solutions provides a unique and advantageous entry point into the realm of high-value, high-growth private companies.
